## What Project Masjid Is
Maunatul Muslimeen Society of CA (MMSC) is a non-profit organization that provides prayer services to the local community. Per the client's request, BasiqCoders built a unique solution for their community by building a robust website for a way of fostering community among the attendees, providing important announcements, prayer times, and an admin portal for the leaders to add/update changes without requiring any coding by the user.
  
Project Masjid is led and implemented by the development team of BasiqCoders which is composed of undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. The team comprises Iman-Tyson Abboud, Mansoor Ali, Shahroz Hamid, Giovany Nunez, Roberto Ramil, Mark Ures, Simon Vu Truong, and Corliss Yang.

 - Visual Studio 1.99.2
 - Java SE Runtime Environment 23.0.2+7-58
 - Git 2.46.2

 - JavaScript (ES6) code snippets 1.8.0
This will add code previews and suggestion support to Visual studio to allow you to code more efficiently by providing autocompletions of current variables and JavaScript functions. Pull code from the repository. Once the above installations have been completed you can then clone the repository of the CodeBase onto your computer.
It is recommended to first create a directory on your computer which will be easy to navigate to for you to clone the repository into, this could be somewhere such as your desktop. Once visual studio has been opened, clone the following repository to visual studio: https://github.com/RobertoRamil/ProjectMasjid cloning it to the directory you created in the step above.
